excerpt: 'This study introduces SenSeqNet, a deep learning framework aimed at the detection of cellular senescence from protein sequences, addressing the limitations of traditional wet lab assays. By employing the Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM-2) for feature extraction followed by a hybrid architecture incorporating long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model achieved an accuracy of 86.43% on independent testing benchmarks.'
