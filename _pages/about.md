I’m Hanli Jiang, a PhD student in Molecular Genetics (Computational Biology) at the University of Toronto. I trained in Computer Science during my undergraduate degree (UofT, 2025) and now work at the intersection of cancer biology and deep learning, with a interest on how modern AI can accelerate biological discovery.

My PhD research uses spatial transcriptomics to study developing brain tissues and brain tumors, asking how tumors mimic normal developmental spatial organization. By mapping these “spatial programs” across healthy and malignant contexts, I aim to uncover new therapeutic vulnerabilities and build computational tools that translate complex spatial data into actionable biological insight.
